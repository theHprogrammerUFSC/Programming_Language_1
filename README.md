## ⚠️ Some Cares

_If you are a student at UFSC and depending on your professor, this subject is fully protected against plagiarism. So think twice before just copying the works. I recommend using this material for reference._

-   To Compile: _gcc main.c -g -o out ("main.c" or "\*.c" for multiple files or "<name>.c" if not used "main")_
-   To Run: _./out_
-   To check for leaks: _valgrind --leak-check=full ./out (Linux)_
